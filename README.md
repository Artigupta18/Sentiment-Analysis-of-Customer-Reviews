# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Customer-Reviews
For this sentiment analysis, I used the IMDb Reviews Dataset, a publicly available dataset containing 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. The dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for further processing.

The dataset contains two columns:

review: The actual text of the customer review.
sentiment: The label indicating whether the review is positive or negative.
